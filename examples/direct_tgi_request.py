once a person takes possession of a physical object or tract of land it's up to her how it's used and what is done with it to the extent that in so doing she doesn't attack other people's bodies or justly acquired possessions 3 this means in particular that someone with a just possessory claim freely permits someone else to take possession of an object or tract of land that is hers on any mutually agreeable terms if I'm right about the baseline rules then while it will be true in some sense that possessory norms are conventions they are tightly constrained conventions since fairness seems to require that reasonable possessory norms incorporate the baseline rules a look at some relevant considerations will help to make clear how they support the baseline rules accessibility all other things being equal presuming in particular that costs can't be shifted onto the unwilling as so often happens in connection with abuses ranging from slavery to pollution everyone benefits as supplies of the goods and services people want increases and their costs decrease if people's possessory rights are stable so that they can bargain with others and keep what they are promised in return for goods and services they provide they are more likely to produce those goods and services in desirable quantities at desirable prices autonomy people tend to want autonomy they want to be able to make their own decisions without at minimum forcible interference from others stable possessory claims enable people to preserve their autonomy so it will be unreasonable for most people not to favor rules that protect such claims coordination coordinating the behavior of economic actors setting prices and determining production levels and distribution patterns can be a rational activity only if people have stable possessory rights compensation stable possessory rights enable peopl\n"
